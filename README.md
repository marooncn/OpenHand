# OpenHand
     A lightweight hand based on Yale OpenHand Project.
     The total weight of Model T is 490g, I reduce half of its weight to use for aerial robots which 
     require grasping hand to be lightweight and dexderous. What's more the details are redeisgned to 
     be accordance with Chinese standards and all of the components can be bought at home.
