# OpenHand
     A lightweight hand based on Yale OpenHand Project[https://www.eng.yale.edu/grablab/openhand/model_t.html]. 
     The total weight of Model T is 490g, I reduce half of its weight to use it for aerial robots which require 
     grasping hand is lightweight and dexderous. And all of the components can be found at home.
